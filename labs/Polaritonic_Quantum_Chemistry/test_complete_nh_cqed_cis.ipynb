    "This tutorial builds from the Psi4Numpy tutorial on canonical CIS for molecular systems, that implements the configuration interaction singles method in the spin orbital notation. The groundwork for working in the spin orbital notation has been laid out in \"Introduction to the Spin Orbital Formulation of Post-HF methods\" [tutorial](../08_CEPA0_and_CCD/8a_Intro_to_spin_orbital_postHF.ipynb). It is highly recommended to work through that introduction before starting this tutorial. \n",

    "We propose a novel formulation of ab initio CQED that couples an ab initio molecular Hamiltonian to a non-Hermitian photonic Hamiltonian to capture the finite lifetime and energy uncertainty of nanoconfined optical resonances.   As a first realization of this theory, will develop a configuration interaction singles approach for the energy eigenstates of this non-Hermitian polaritonic Hamiltonian, which will allow us to leverage tools of modern quantum chemistry, including analytic evaluation of forces and nonadiabatic couplings, to study polaritonic structure and reactivity.  This will pave the way for future developments of a hierarchy of CI-based approaches that can be systematically improved in terms of their accuracy, and are also interoperable with the powerful machinery of quantum chemistry codes.  In particular, we envision that Complete Active Space CI theory, which has been a particularly promising approach for simulating photochemistry, can be merged with NH-CQED to provide a powerful tool for simulating polaritonic chemistry.\n",

A cubic spline is a simple model function of the form $f(R) = a + bR + cR^2 + dR^3$ that allows estimation of the potential energy curves at arbitrary values of $R$ within the finite range scanned by the *ab initio* calculations.  We will do the same for the transition dipole moment, $\\mu_{ge}(R)$.\n",

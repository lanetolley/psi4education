When the energy of the trapped photon ($\\hbar \\omega$) matches this excitation energy in a particular region of the MgH+ potential energy surface, energy can be \n",
    "rapidly exchanged between the molecular excitation and the cavity.  We can think of this exchange as cylcing between  the molecule absorbing the trapped photon and becoming excited, and relaxing back to the ground-state and emitting the a photon which becomes trapped in the cavity.  When this cycling is rapid, as is the case when the interaction \n",
    "is strong, the cycling of energy makes it impossible to distinguish between the quantum state of the excited molecule and the quantum state of the photon localized in the cavity.  Rather, we think of this situation as a hybrid state that is part light part matter, and we call this state a polariton.  One fascinating feature of molecular polaritons\n",

    "We will fit a cubic spline to the data obtained for the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces ($E_g(R)$ and $E_e(R)$) obtained from the TDDFT calculations.  A cubic spline is a simple model function of the form $f(R) = a + bR + cR^2 + dR^3$ that allows estimation of the potential energy curves at arbitrary values of $R$ within the finite range scanned by the *ab initio* calculations.  We will do the same for the transition dipole moment, $\\mu_{ge}(R)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that the independent variable data are the bondlengths $R$ stored in the numpy array `rs`, and the dependent variable data are the ground- and excited-state potential energy surface data stored in the `Es` array.  The transition dipole moment data is stored in the array `mu_z`. \n",

    "#### Review of rules for the projection operators for electronic states\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operators for molecular electronic states are denoted\n",
    "$|n\\rangle \\langle m|$ where again $|n\\rangle = \\psi_n$ is known as the *ket* for electronic state $n$, \n",
    "and $\\langle m |= \\psi_m^*$ is known as the *bra* for electronic state $m$. \n",
    "In this notebook, we will restrict the electronic states to the ground state (denoted $|g\\rangle$) \n",
    "and the first excited state (denoted $|e\\rangle$).  \n",
    "Let us examine the contribution that arises from the $E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\langle g|$\n",
    "term in the Hamiltonian between the basis state $|g,0\\rangle = |g\\rangle |0\\rangle$\n",
    "on the bra and the ket:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "& \\langle g|\\langle0| \\left( E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\langle g|\\right)| g\\rangle  |0\\rangle \\\\\n",

    "&= E_g(R)  \\langle g | g \\rangle \\\\\n",
    "&= E_g(R)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where we have used the fact that the projection operator $|g\\rangle \\langle g|$\n",
    "only acts on the electronic states, so we were able to factor out our photonic bra\n",
    "and kets $\\langle 0 | 0 \\rangle = 1$, and then we were also able \n",
    "to bring the ground-state energy eigenvalue $E_g(R)$ outside the integral in the second-to-last step just leaving $E_g(R) \\langle g | g \\rangle = E_g(R)$.\n",

    "where $|\\rangle$ denotes a fermionic Fock vacuum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photonic lowering operators generally obey $\\hat{b}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle$, so for the\n",
